# Are the Smart Contract on Q&A Site Reliable?
To support the open science community, we publish the studied dataset. 
| Dataset | Source | Contract | Function |
|---------|---------|---------|---------|
| Full Dataset | ESE Post | 11,278 | 32,713 |
|  | Ethereum | 179,683 | 692,546 |
| Test Dataset | ESE Post | 7,161 | 6,337 |
|  | Ethereum | 69,322 | 130,287 |

The Full Dataset is the scope we conduct the empirical study. The Test Dataset is a subset of the Full Dataset, and is constructed for testing the effectiveness of detectable files in our study.
